## 🤖 Machine Learning Integration (Coming Soon)
SLution is being integrated with a custom-trained ML model that recognizes sign language gestures from live camera input using TensorFlow Lite.  
The model runs locally on the device and will be seamlessly integrated into the translation screen for real-time feedback.  

During testing, fallback options will be provided if the model is unavailable. This feature will be fully evaluated in a future release cycle.
